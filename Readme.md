"kaigix10" is a sample made for study.  
â€» I'm not an app developer...


## PURPOSE
Have you ever felt that this is a useless meeting?  
But many people don't say it.   
  
Why is that?  
  
It is because it can not be judged whether it is really useless.  
So let's visualize the cost of the meeting.  
  
This app visualizes the amount of money spent on a conference in real time simply by entering the number of people.  
  
That would be a lot more than you think.  
  
Now, use this app to eliminate unnecessary meetings.  
  
## NOTE
This app is a sample.  
The number of people and the unit price are hard coded.  
I hope that someone will fall into a more sophisticated app.
